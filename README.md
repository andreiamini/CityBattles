CityBattles
====================
CityBattles is a application built by Liza Amini, Max Solomon, Edward Parkin, and Sailesh Patel. It was built as a part of Young Rewired State's Festival of Code (#YRS2014). The aim of CityBattles is to allow users to see which cities are smarter by geotracking users using Google's Geolocation API, and then making them complete an online quiz, with the points for each correct answer going towards their city. There is also a leadership board where users can see these scores.

The website is built on Node.js, and uses AJAX to send global variables from the client side to the server side and via versa, while Google's Geolocation API is utilitised. We used Jade to build the webpages as Node.js renders Jade in to HTML.
